## About Me
Hi! I'm Angus. I have an academic background and have a Bachelors of Science degree in [Economics](https://github.com/AngusRatski/Angus_Ratcliffe_Dissertation/blob/main/Degree.pdf) from the Manchester Metropolitan University, where I specialised in econometric analysis. I have five years of experience with analytics, and I am now adding to my technology stack and my skillset as part of the London School of Economics' Data Analytics Career Accelerator Programme, where I have developed the following skills: Data cleaning and processing using SQL and creating dashboards using Tableau. Advanced analytics in Python (using NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn) and R Studio.

## LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator Projects
### Course 1: Analytics for Business
In this course of the programme, we utilised Microsoft Excel, SQL and Tableau to clean data, perform an exploratory analysis and visualise findings for the supermarket 2Market. In this project, the client has asked us to determine which demographics, which products and which marketing channels are the most popular/effective. <br>

## Econometrics BSc Final Project
This dissertation contains a panel data analysis of bilateral trade between the UK and the rest of the world outside the EU, between the years 1973 and 2019. The aim of the dissertation is to identify some strong trade relationships between the UK and the rest of the world during the time that the UK has been a part of the EU. This analysis also aims to highlight emerging trade relationships which could be beneficial to the UK post-Brexit. The analysis itself is built around the Gravity Model of Trade (Tinbergen 1962) and the many adjustments that has been made to the model since its inception. <br>
