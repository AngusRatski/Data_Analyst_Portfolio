## About Me
Hi! I'm Angus. I have an academic background and have a Bachelors of Science degree in [Economics](file:///C:/Users/angus/Downloads/Degree.pdf) (1st Class) from the Manchester Metropolitan University, where I specialised in econometric analysis. I have five years of experience with analytics, and I am now adding to my technology stack and my skillset as part of the London School of Economics' Data Analytics Career Accelerator Programme, where I have developed the following skills: Data cleaning and processing using SQL and creating dashboards using Tableau. Advanced analytics in Python (using NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn) and R Studio.
